This innovative approach combines sustainable design with community needs, creating a space that serves both environmental and recreational purposes. By incorporating permeable surfaces, native plantings, and rain gardens, the park will reduce flooding risks while providing residents with a beautiful, accessible green space for recreation and relaxation.',
